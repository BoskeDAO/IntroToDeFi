## Meetup Participation
- every memeber will be asked to talk about a concept 

## Medium Articles
- Every group will submit 1 article describing the insights, research notes, advances in roadmap, design document, code snippets regarding the topic learned during that week. 
- Every week, a different member of the group will assume the "documentation and presentation" responsibility, and will post the article with his medium profile, for later accounting
- Articles will be reviewd by our editors before being published. If the article is rejected, you will have another week to improve it or leave the comunity... just kidding, or not?
