## How can we explore the Blockchain

When interacting with DeFi applications it is important to understand how to **read the blockchain** and see and verify your actions, here some of my favorite block explorers.

* https://www.blockchain.com/explorer
* https://bloxy.info/
* https://ethplorer.io/
* https://etherscan.io/ 

**We will mostly use Etherscan throughout the course**

## Install MetaMask

Please install Metamask and be sure to back-up the private key:

#Assignments

## Using the DAI savings rate - Assignment
DeFi Protocol Deep Dive
Let's put what we have learned into practice and open a maker CDP mint some DAI tokens then let's park these DAI tokens into compound, Chai or Oasis or if you just want to test use the kovan Etherum network 
* https://oasis.app/save?network=kovan 

When locking Etherum in a Maker DAO CDP and then borrowing you collateral to another protocol do you see any interesting market opportunities? Or do you have any cool ideas of new building blocks that we can build together let's discuss it in this forum thread.

## Keep learning - Assignment
Next Step
Now it is time to find your own comfort zone and dive deeper into the DeFi ecosystem and explore its possibilities. Start looking for cool arbitrage opportunities or see what new DeFi building block you want to build?

Let's keep discussing all interesting DeFi projects in the forum and let's see how we as a whole can strengthen this new parallel financial system. 

Let's maintain our DeFi Ecosystem overview together.

# DeFi 201

Did you get excited and need some help with a DeFi project checkout: https://venten.co always happy to hear about exciting new projects or help you out with some Yield Hacking strategies.
It is time to build a new financial system!
 
## Prerequisites

We recommend to first fully complete DeFi 101 before diving deeper in DeFi 201. Also when we will start yield hacking and Flash Loan programming a basic understanding of Blockchain, Bitcoin, Etherum, Solidity, and trading is needed.
 
We recommend you first follow the following course before starting DeFi 201:
* DeFi 101
* Ethereum Smart Contract Programming 101
* Blockchain & Bitcoin 101
* Algorithmic Trading & Technical Analysis

## DeFi Ecosystem - Discussion
The State of DeFi

I would like to invite you to explore the DeFi ecosystem by yourself. I did this as well and made a short DeFi Ecosystem Overview (I did this paper for ongoing personal research into a DeFi/CeFi Bridge I want to build). I would encourage all to do something similar and see what elements in the decentralized financial stack attract you the most.

A Token Curated Registries (TCR) with interesting WEB 3 projects has been created: https://everest.link/ contribute to the ecosystem by contributing to this TCR with your input.
It is hard to keep lists a TCR model is a popular crypto economic primitive. Wanne learn more about TCR’s check: https://transform.eoi.digital/token-curated-registries/

## DeFi digital finance stack - Discussion
Blockchain-based Financial Markets

Similar to DeFi 101 I want to challenge you to explore the DeFi digital finance stack to spot new building blocks that are essential to the DeFi digital finance stack. As you see we need a very multitalented pool of people to make this movement into a reality so find your comfort zone in the DeFi stack and become an expert and gain unfair knowledge advantages.


Since it is DeFi 201 Let's dive a bit deeper and let's take our forum discussions to the next level let's read some in-depth scientific articles and let's voice our opinions, ideas, and feedback.

Let's take our discussion to the next level.
I'm looking forward to debating you on the forum

I did this paper for ongoing personal research into a DeFi/CeFi Bridge I want to build here: DeFi Ecosystem Overview I recommend everyone to also start making a paper like this when you have an idea/project or new career path you want to build.

## Get Real world Assets on the BlockChain - Assignment
Real world Assets on the Blockchain
For the overall ecosystem growth, it is important that more users start to understand, trust, and use protocols that interface real-world assets (RWA) with blockchain. Let's make this the new normal ;) I assign all to find interesting new protocols that interact with the real world and show proof of purchase in the forum thread. For now, you can use https://opensea.io/assets/wiv but soon many more will follow.


Also, there is an ongoing debate if we need to be whitelisted KYC/AML embed in a token/protocol to make Real-World Assets on the BlockChain work. what do you think? In my opinion, we should strive towards a system where KYC/AML is not needed since I see Access to an open and privacy preserve financial system is a basic human right 
* https://www.openmoneyinitiative.org/    


If you find any new protocols that bring real-world assets to the blockchain, let's list them on the forum and discuss their technical architecture of how they bridge CeFi/DeFi.

## Yield Hacking Strategy - Discussion
Become your own hedge fund
As we all got this far I assume we understand we need to become our own bank but as said at the start we can go deeper than that. By becoming your own Bank you also have the freedom to manage your own funds and thanks to DeFi we now all have financial superpowers and capabilities that are normally only for the 1%. Let's use our new knowledge wisely and discuss, explore, and test Yield Hacks together. As Andrey Explained to us always be aware of the risk you're taking or trading with, do not be too greedy and ignorant.
 
Let's start an in-depth forum discussion on cool Yield Hacking Strategy I will be publishing some of my personal strategies soon: * https://forum.ivanontech.com/t/become-your-own-hedge-fund-yield-hacking-strategy-discussion/16638

## Flash loan assignment/discussion
Lets hack Flash Loans
Now you have all the knowledge to execute Flash Loans by yourself. There is a lot of opportunity in  the market that can result in massive gains but remember that every gain you generate is because you took a risk.
 
If you're feeling prompt go to our Github page and perform all three assessments and share your experiences and gains in the forum. The clones and code is set up on a first come first serve basis lets see how stable both Uniswap V1 and Uniswap V2 markets will get ;)

Github: 
* https://github.com/Robsonsjre/FlashloanUsecases 

Uniswap V1:

Uniswap V2:

Also let's discuss all interesting use cases for Flash Loans today Flash Loans are mostly used for arbitrage. But flash loans have other more compelling use cases in DeFi. One example is refinancing loans. Say I have a Maker vault (CDP) with $100 of ETH locked in it, and I drew a loan of 40 DAI from it—so I’ve got a $60 net position minus my debt. Now say I want to refinance into Compound for a better interest rate. Normally I’d need to go out and repurchase that 40 DAI to close out my CDP, which requires some up-front capital. Instead, I can flash borrow 40 DAI, close out the $100 CDP, deposit $60 of my unlocked ETH into Compound, convert the other $40 of ETH back into DAI through Uniswap, and use that to repay the flash loan. Boom, atomic 0-capital refinancing.
 
Let me know the results of your assessment and let’s discuss Flash Loan use cases in the forum.
